Description: These functions are used in John Bullock's code; they are 
  typically needed for replication purposes. They range in complexity from a 
  function that just removes NA values from a vector prior to summing it 
  (sumNA) to a function that transforms regression output into LaTeX tables 
  of the style that Bullock likes (latable).
