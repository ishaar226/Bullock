This package contains utilities that I use in my R code. Most of them don't seem to exist in any other package. 

Don't emulate the code in this package. It works, but it isn't pretty.

Installation instructions: first, be sure that you have installed the `devtools` package. Then run `devtools::install_github('jbullock35/Bullock')`.
