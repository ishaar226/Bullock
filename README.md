This package contains utilities that I use in my R code. Most of them don't 
seem to have equivalents in any other package. 

The package's largest feature is a set of tools for table-making. See 
the [Building better tables in less time](https://jbullock35.github.io/Bullock/tables.html)
vignette for an introduction. [Using <tt>latexTable()</tt> with R Markdown documents](https://jbullock35.github.io/Bullock/tables_RMarkdown.html)
may also be helpful. 

Installation instructions: 

    # install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("jbullock35/Bullock", build_vignettes = TRUE)

If you have problems with the package, please feel free to [post an issue](https://github.com/jbullock35/Bullock/issues) or to [write to&nbsp;me](mailto:john@johnbullock.org). I will be happy to help.
